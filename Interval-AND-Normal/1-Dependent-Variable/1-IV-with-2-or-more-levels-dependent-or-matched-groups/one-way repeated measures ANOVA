You would perform a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance if you had one categorical independent variable and a normally distributed interval dependent variable that was repeated at least twice for each subject.  This is the equivalent of the paired samples t-test, but allows for two or more levels of the categorical variable. The one-way repeated measures ANOVA tests whether the mean of the dependent variable differs by the categorical variable.  We have an example data set called rb4wide, which is used in Kirk's book Experimental Design.  In this data set, y1 y2 y3 and y4 represent the dependent variable measured at the 4 levels of a, the repeated measures independent variable.
