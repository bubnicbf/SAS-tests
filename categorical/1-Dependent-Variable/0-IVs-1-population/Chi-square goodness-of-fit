/*
A chi-square goodness of fit test allows us to test whether the observed proportions for a categorical variable differ from hypothesized proportions.  For example, let's suppose that we believe that the general population consists of 10% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 10% African American and 70% White folks.  We want to test whether the observed proportions from our sample differ significantly from these hypothesized proportions.  The hypothesized proportions are placed in parentheses after the testp= option on the tables statement.
